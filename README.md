# Groundwater_Consumption
The project aims to track and possibly control the consumption of groundwater.
# Preview
This is an IoT-based project that calculates the amount of groundwater consumed in a household, and regularly notifies the owner in case the consumption exceeds a specific set limit by the owner. The model is connected to a working motor that pumps water to the over-head tank, that inturn supplies water to the entire household. This approach is especially useful if the household is located in regions with probable water scarcity. The statistical data acquired by the model is updated and stored in the cloud, and is represented in easy-to-understand pictographs in the app, which is installed into the user's smart phone. This is mainly possible with the help of some very cost-effective components such as a bluetooth module and a Wi-Fi module. This is a very simple and efficient solution, with the potential to address some of the more serious concerns in today's society.
# Hardware Components
• PCB/Breadboard
• Arduino UNO
• YFS201 Water Flow Meter
• HC-05 Bluetooth Module
• SSD1306 OLED Screen
• Connecting Wires
# Mobile app
The app is in an apk format which can be readily installed by the user into his/her smart phone. The app is coded mostly by using Java, with some frontend HTML code for the user's convenience. The downloadable app is also attached here.
